# Odoo-One2many-Portal

✔ Once this model is downloaded first this which you have to do is change model name from "Odoo-One2many-Portal-main" to "one2many_portal" so, you will not face the error's like 'ValueError: View 'one2many_portal.form_template' in website 1 not found' while installing or while clicking on 'One2many' tab on portal form.

✔ Here I have created a module named One2many where I have created One2many field on portal. On submit of the record same record will be created on the backend side.
